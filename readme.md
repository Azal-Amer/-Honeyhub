**HONEYHUB SIMULATOR**

*Scenarios to run through:*

* Hacker reaches fake login page from Honeyhub
* Hacker bypasses Honeyhub, enters network, and changes files in an IoT device (authentication)
* Hacker tries to intercept transmission of key
* Hacker hacks the router itself

All scenarios should end with the Honeyhub fixing the infected device.

Perhaps we can make the user select an option (scenario) as the 'hacker'?

*Interactive options on screen:*
* Add and remove IoT devices to network
* Change Wi-Fi
* Add terminals
* CHOOSE A METHOD FOR THE HACKER TO FOLLOW

*Stuff we need to code:*
* Classes for basic parts of network (computer, router, honeyhub)
* Logins for honeyhub
* File sizes in computers(partitions)
* Encryption / authentication algorithm for Honey Key
* Connection & hacked/not hacked status
